## Description:

This is a quiz app made in .NET WPF were you start with a default quiz of 5 questions with images.
This application allows creating new quizes, adding, editing and removing questions.
You can even add images to your questions.

## What I learned:

This was a test for creating something larger with OOP in C# which taught me the basic of how a class is divided into partial classes when .xaml files are introduced.

I even applied the MVVM-concept so that the classes were isolated and not dependant on eachother, which also created a beautiful well organised directory structure in my solution explorer.
